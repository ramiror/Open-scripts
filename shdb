# "An 'apendealo' replacement"
# shdb will append whatever you type to a "database" located in your database directory
# (currently hardcoded to ~/shdb. The name of the datbase would match the name of the 
# executable, so to create a new database you should copy the binary... or if you're 
# smart, you'd hard-link it :)
# If it's called w/o params, it simply shows the contents of the... well, "database"

YO=$(basename $0)
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
	cat ~/shdb/$YO
else
	echo $(hoy) $* >> ~/shdb/$YO
